Welcome to Microwley-Scanner, a packet analysis tool designed for the everyday IT professional! As a network engineer, I was challenged to quickly capture and analyze network traffic to troubleshoot security and network issues effectively. 

Microwley-Scanner aims to simplify this process by offering intuitive tools for network scanning, packet capture, and log analysis, all tailored for quick and actionable insights. With my experience in recognizing traffic patterns for healthy and struggling networks, Iâ€™ve set out to make traffic analysis accessible for anyone looking to maintain optimal network performance.

In the early stages of development, Microwley-Scanner will evolve to provide a seamless experience for IT teams and individuals alike. Follow along for updates as we bring this vision to life!
